# DND Interview Devops

This is intended to be a short exercise to test your ability to read and understand some fairly basic examples of 

* Terraform
* Kubernetes

The details for each of these are contained in their respective folders. 
The examples we've chosen purposefull have mistakes in them that should be easy to pick up for people experienced with both platforms, 
and the prep contained in each should be achievable in under an hour.

Where we've missed any details you feel are relevant feel free to make an assumption about what the answer would be, 
and please raise this with us in your interview.
